# Using Ant-Design 5 with UmiJS 4 and Tailwind CSS

Unlike antdpro, this is a lighter template and the main feature is the use of tailwind.
You can trim the code as needed.

## Features

- [UmiJS 4](https://github.com/umijs/umi)
- [Ant-Design 5](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
- Automatic import sorting with [@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports)

- Globalization, support for complex json

## Attentions

- You should use [Mock file directory](https://umijs.org/docs/guides/mock#mock) instead of mock functions, I just use this to generate online demo
